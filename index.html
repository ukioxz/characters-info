"If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights..."
After a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.
They refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.
As per his father's wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.
No matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.
</p><br><p>But the words of praise he valued most of all were:
"Good job. Now, that's my son."
His father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.
His faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.</p></h3>
